# Tour Planning

A small project for a scaffolding company. 
The aim is to replace a confusing Excel spreadsheet, in which the annual route planning takes place, with a web app. 
This web app should make it possible to create routes, view routes in the calendar and edit routes. 
The webapp consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS. The backend is written with Python, using Flask.
The data is stored in a database. 
The data is protected by a login page. The data cannot be accessed without a login.
The project can be extended as required, see TODO.md
